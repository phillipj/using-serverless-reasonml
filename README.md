# Example using [serverless-reasonml](https://github.com/phillipj/serverless-reasonml)

This is a barebones contrived example of using the [serverless-reasonml plugin](https://github.com/phillipj/serverless-reasonml).
In addition to showing the configuration, structure and dependencies needed to get serverless
projects with ReasonML up-n-running, it uses [@ahrefs/bs-aws-lambda](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-aws-lambda) to get
all the types support from ReasonML along the way.
